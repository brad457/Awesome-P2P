Curated list of awesome Peer to Peer projects

##Protocols

###Named Data Networking 

Inspired by Content Centric Networking, Named Data Networking (NDN) is a next-generation Future Internet architecture, that focuses on content, rather than location. In other words, instead of looking to a certain location for a file, just look for the file, which may exist in many locations. I think this concept could even be applied to a lot of publishing and social media platforms right now to eliminate a lot of overhead.

###SecuShare 

    SecuShare is a combination of the PSYC protocol 
    which is "the fastest 
    yet extensible text-based protocol...providing a messaging infrastructure for human conversation and social exchange of possibly binary data," providing a huge improvement over XML-based 
    solutions like XMPP/Jabber and GNUnet 
    , "a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking that does not use any centralized or otherwise trusted services," offering stronger anonymity and other benefits 
    as compared to similar projects.

Prophet 

    While in need of a new maintainer, Prophet is "a grounded, semirelational, peer to peer replicated, disconnected, versioned, property database with self-healing conflict resolution." It's "a new kind of database designed for the post Web-2.0 world. It's made to let you collaborate with your friends and coworkers without needing any kind of special server or internet provider." Let me know if anything more recent has applied these concepts, because they offer a lot.

Dash Evolution 

    Dash 
    already offers a lot more than most currently available cryptocurrencies, primarily truly strong privacy through built-in distributed mixing (whereas for example with bitcoin you have to trust third-party centralized mixers), and Evolution is just the next step offering even more including a decentralized shared file system, decentralized wallets, and social features.

BùúÄtrFS 

    B-Trees are pretty popular in the current generation, but what about fractal trees 
    ? That's what BetrFS uses, and what it offers is pretty cool. I'd also be interested in a dynamic non-hierarchical file system 
    .

TokuDB 

    Also using a fractal tree index is TokuDB, not much explanation needed.

Camp 
/Darcs 

    The concepts 
    behind these two are how revision control should be approached, though perhaps they could also benefit from the concepts offered by Simple Defects 
    , "a peer-to-peer bug tracker that‚Äôs built for sharing and use both online and offline," which allows you to "sync your bugs back and forth between other instances of SD, and even between SD and other bug trackers that SD supports," based on the aforementioned Prophet P2P database. A complete dream package I think would also offer integrated distributed issue tracking and wiki like Veracity 

Daala 

    This "next-next generation" video codec leaps ahead of the single next-gen codecs VP9 and HEVC (H.265) by using lapped transform instead of discrete cosine transform 
    which also incidentally avoids most of the patents in the video codec arena.

Happstack 

    This Haskell 
    -based web framework is powerful, elegant, and supremely fast (soon to be faster once the new Hyperdrive server 
    is complete. The maintainer also has the right idea in working on Clckwrs 
    a flat-file CMS aiming to be a just-as-easy alternative to Wordpress.

Tox 

    This is the most usable solution to offer decentralized end-to-end encrypted text, audio, and video messaging and conferencing.

Mercury 

    This programming language is functional like Haskell, but also offers the additional ability of logic programming.
